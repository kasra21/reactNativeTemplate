# ReactNativeTemplate/ReactProjectDirectDeploy

This is a sample template for React-native initialized with `react-native init`

### How do I get set up?

Either a device emulator (android or iOS) or an actually device needs to be plugged into the machine:

* **For Android**:

the dependency for react-navigation:

  `npm install --save react-navigation`

Make sure `android avd` is running.
Then run:

  `react-native run-android`
